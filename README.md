# WW-Demo-ListPost

In this POC I will show you how you can create an widget or web part that show you a list of posts from SharePoint blog site. The element is done purely as client side coding. One thing that is true with SharePoint is the fact that you can do the same things in multiple ways. Same goes here with this example, but my aim here is to demonstrate how you can create plugins, web parts, apps however you want to call them, easily and purely as client side development. I think that a word widget is most descriptive, and that is what we will be using here. 

This example is based on real life solution that I made on my last project on top of SharePoint 2013 on-prem. The widget is also tested to be working in SharePoint Online. Technically you could use it any other web platform, and that is the key why I want to present you a framework called Widget Wrangler. 

You can find more detailed description from my blog - [Use case: List Posts - Using Widget Wrangler and AngularJS in the web part development](http://wp.me/p1yXYi-5J)
